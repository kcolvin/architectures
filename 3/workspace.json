Hazardous Attitudes\n\n## GOTCHA\n\n***Ground Observational Technologies Changing Hazardous Attitudes***\n\n### Intake Form\n\n**Date:** 1/18/2022\n\n**Organization Name:** San Bernardino County – Land Use Services\n\t\n**Location of Organization:** San Bernardino, CA\n\n**Executive Sponsor:** Steven Raughley\n\n**Primary Contact:** Steven Roughley\n\n**Organization’s Mission:**\n>We envision a complete county that capitalizes on the diversity of its people, its geography, and its economy to create a broad range of choices for its residents in how they live, work, and play. \n>\n>We envision a vibrant economy with a skilled workforce that attracts employers who seize the opportunities presented by the county's unique advantages and provide the jobs that create countywide prosperity. \n>\n>We envision a sustainable system of high-quality education, community health, public safety, housing, retail, recreation, arts and culture, and infrastructure, in which development complements our natural resources and environment. \n>\n>We envision a model community which is governed in an open and ethical manner, where great ideas are replicated and brought to scale, and all sectors work collaboratively to reach shared goals. \n>\n>From our valleys, across our mountains, and into our deserts, we envision a county that is a destination for visitors and a home for anyone seeking a sense of community and the best life has to offer.\n\n**Describe the problem or opportunity to be addressed:**\n\n>Illegal dumping is a problem that exists throughout the unincorporated areas of San Bernardino County in the valley, mountain, and desert communities.  People illegally dump a wide variety of items, trash, and hazardous materials which creates blight in the communities where this dumping occurs and negatively impacts the environment.  Illegal dumping can occur on private or public land and in remote or urbanized areas.  Citizens can file complaints and Code Enforcement does some proactive clean up, but this is a reactionary response.    The county bears a substantial cost of time and money to clean up illegal dumping and when possible, attempts to issue citations those responsible.  Without a mechanism to actively monitor and catch those dumping illegally, the county is unable to effectively issue citations in an attempt to deter illegal dumping.\n\n**What software applications or services are used today to help solve this problem?**\n\n>Code Enforcement sometimes utilizes trap cameras in high frequency dumping areas to document illegal dumping activity.  This is a very labor-intensive operation and is not done frequently due to the labor involved with the set up, tear down, and analysis of the footage.  Staff must pull the memory cards and review the images to determine if illegal dumping has occurred as the cameras will take pictures based off of motion. \n>\n>Members of the public can utilize the Code Enforcement ArcGIS site to report and submit illegal dumping complaints and utilize geolocation by clicking on a location on a map and can also upload pictures. \n>\n>Staff utilize ArcGIS and Survey123 to map and identify property boundaries and document what has been removed.\n\n**Describe how you might be able to better serve your customers/stakeholders if a solution were implemented:**\n\n>If a solution was implemented to reduce the occurrence of illegal dumping, there would be positive impacts on the environment due to the proper disposal of the waste.  Blight would be eliminated which would provide an enhanced quality of life for residents and visitors.  Additionally, a reduction in staff time required to abate and enforce would occur, allowing staffing to be reallocated to other Code Enforcement related functions.\n\n**What would the key metrics of success be: (optional)**\n\n>- Increase in number of citations to illegal dumpers\n>- Decrease in reported illegal dumping incidents\n>- Reduction in the amount of time spent by staff on illegal dumping\n\n**During our engagement, do you expect to provide data that is required to be protected from public view?** \n\n>No.\n\n**If so, how do you plan to cleanse the data?**\n\n>NA\n\n**Please provide contact information for the individual responsible for data information and access.**\n\n>NA\n\n**Who are your customers/stakeholders – both intermediary (ex. Faculty) and end users (ex. Students):**\n\n>Sheriff’s Department, SB County Public Works - Solid Waste Management Division, SB County Environmental Health Services, SB County Land Use Services\n\n### Press Release\n\n***\n\n*This document is a ‘fictitious press release’ envisioning the launch of a new product or service at a future date.

The name ***GOTCHA*** is an acronym for Ground Observational Technologies Changing Hazardous Attitudes. When fully operational, the automated system will detect and notify county personnel of new illegal dumping through data from multiple sources, allowing for both enforcement and mitigation efforts to begin, and the collection of prosecutable evidence to identify and cite the offenders. The system intends to increase awareness for the public, changing their attitude towards the negative consequences of illegal dumping including environmental impact, public health, flood control operations and community blight. The system utilizes GIS data to only send alerts for areas within Code Enforcement’s jurisdiction saving time in this vast county of over 20,000 square miles. In essence, ***GOTCHA*** is an automated, county-wide watchdog for illegal dumping activities.\n\n#### **Problem**\n\nWhile Illegal Dumping is a problem worldwide, it poses a particular problem for San Bernardino County with its many dispersed suburban unincorporated areas and large sparsely populated remote desert areas. These illegal activities result in negative effects for the environment including toxic waste, blockage of flood control channels and wind-strewn litter. Further, as many of these illegal dump sites appear in densely populated areas, public health risks increase with decomposing trash, dangerous chemicals and safety concerns like abandoned refrigerators and other hazardous items. Finally, the morale of many citizens and county visitors is decreased by the blight, decay and feelings of civil disorder left by visible dump sites. Currently, the county estimates that it spends more than $1 million/year on identification, tracking, cleanup, and enforcement efforts.  Yet, the county estimates that it is aware of just 20% of the dump sites and prosecutes less than 1% of the offenders countywide.\n\n#### **Approach** \n\nAt the core, ***GOTCHA*** integrates four technology components to detect illegal dumping activities and act: aerial imagery, ground-based deployable assets, surveillance video and citizen and staff electronic “tipping”.\n\nAt the highest level, computer algorithms ingest and analyze **aerial imagery** obtained from satellites and high-quality aerial flyovers, looking for specific pixel-pattern changes that are the tell-tale signs of new illegal dumping activity. The detection triggers the creation of an electronic event which logs the time and location of the event into the county’s existing tracking system, concurrently alerting both enforcement and mitigation personnel.\n\nOn the ground, ***GOTCHA*** utilizes and builds on the county’s deployable assets infrastructure of ***small Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS)***.  Using staff that are FAA Part 107 certified staff pilots and for-hire FAA Part 107 pilots, pre-planned flight routes provide high quality photos tagged with actionable dumping information identified through machine learning models.  These are populated into the **GOTCHA** system for staff usage.\n\nDeployable *“sting operation kits”* allow for staff to deploy cameras and sensors to frequently dumped spots.  Historically, the collected video data has been manually reviewed by county personnel resulting in an inefficient use of staff time. **GOTCHA** employs cloud-based computers running machine learning models that analyze captured video and are trained to detect illegal dumping activities. When the model detects such activities in the video, the evidence is recorded, and a similar electronic event is triggered so enforcement and mitigation activities can begin.\n\n#### **Citizen Quote** \n\n>“The improvement is like night and day” said Crestmore Heights resident Susan Serrano. “The corner of Armstrong and Locust was a mess and no matter how many times it was cleaned up, more garbage, mattresses, lumber and concrete would appear. The site is clean and posted with signs that state “Violators Will Be Prosecuted” and they mean it! Even the clutter on my own street and in my neighborhood has improved. We now feel a real pride for The Heights and how we are helping make it look like the great community it is.”\n\nThe final component of **GOTCHA** leverages people across the county, including both **citizens and staff that see and report illegal dumping activities**. Using an ordinary mobile phone, the person merely snaps a photo or records video, then submits the data to the County using a text message, email, or mobile app. The system parses the data, extracting the time, location, and objects in the photo, then triggering the appropriate electronic event to log and report the activity. In a similar pattern to the other technologies, the event triggers enforcement and mitigation actions.  Additionally, texting a number can provide citizens with information about bulky item pickup from their hauler and disposal options to help reduce the desire to illegally dump items that are hard to handle. \n\n#### **Customer Experience**\n\n>“In areas identified as ‘hot spots’ motion activated cameras are deployed for surveillance. The low maintenance required by these cameras and the long-lasting batteries has helped us shift our field hours from servicing cameras to proactively patrol and enforce county code in identified illegal dumping areas” remarked Code Enforcement Officer Jennifer Williams.  “Our conviction success rate has significantly increased due to information being promptly available to officers. The success in identifying, investigating and effectively prosecuting individuals who participate in illegal dumping has had a positive impact on our department’s budget.”\n\nWhen fully developed, **GOTCHA** becomes an implementation of the **“tip & cue” approach**, where large areas are monitored by various low-cost “sensors” (e.g., citizens with mobile phones, surveillance video, aerial images, UAS data, seismic, infrared sensors, motion detectors, etc.). When a relevant event is triggered by a “sensor”, Code Enforcement and mitigation personnel are cued for action. **GOTCHA** leverages cutting edge technology to do the dirty work of monitoring while informing the county on where to deploy its limited, expensive enforcement and mitigation resources. While **GOTCHA** implements new technologies not actively utilized by the County, public education and fines are still complementary to these efforts to create a holistic program.\n\n#### Leader Quote\n\n>“This new approach for tracking and mitigating illegal dumping sites across our vast county is a game changer and is one example of our ‘County of the Future’ vision”, said Pauline Cook, Third District Supervisor for San Bernardino County. “We are actively innovating with new technologies to do more with less, improve community morale and give our citizens a sense of pride for living in San Bernardino County.”\n\nTo learn more about the GOTCHA and the open-source technology platform visit https://GOTCHA.sbcounty.gov\n \n#### Appendix – Additional Testimonials\n\n#### Citizen #2 Quote\n\n>“I used to feel like my efforts to report illegal dumping went unheard” said San Bernardino County resident, Jennifer Miller.  “With **GOTCHA**, I snap a photo on my phone and text it to ‘SBCGOTCHA’ to report illegal dumping. I am immediately sent a link to a portal where I can track the progress of my report. Within a few days, I had visibility into high-resolution aerial imagery and reporting of the dump site I identified, I was able to track progress to remediate the site, and once the cleanup was complete, I could compare the before and after imagery – I felt like my tip made a difference.”\n\n#### Dumper Quote\n\n>“It was a learning experience for me” said David Ditmore, Fontana resident who was cited for illegal dumping near the Auto Club Speedway. “There was a field near the Speedway that always had piles of garbage and waste and it didn’t seem like a big deal that I would just add my few items to the pile on the days I went to the races. Going through the ticketing and education process provided by the county, I now understand how these piles negatively impact my city. You can count on me to help keep the areas around the Speedway monitored and orderly when I attend races.  Now if I have dumping questions I know I can text ‘SBCGOTCHA’ and get the necessary legal dumping information.”\n\n#### SBC Administration Quote\n\n>“We always felt illegal dumping activity was a problem in our county, but GOTCHA has helped us document the size of the problem and quantify the fiscal implications” said Adam Sanchez, Finance Analyst in charge of budget planning. “Now, when we approach the Board of Supervisors with funding requests to address illegal dumping, we can do so with the data to justify our requests. No longer will we be guessing at the size of the problem of illegal dumping in San Bernardino County.”\n\n#### Code Enforcement Supervisor Quote\n\n>“The use of aerial imagery, UAS and motion activated surveillance cameras has played a key role in enhancing our illegal dumping program” said Code Enforcement Supervisor Felix Meza. “Aerial imagery provides us with a viewing platform of a broad coverage area and has helped greatly in identifying illegal dumping sites that would not have been possible otherwise. Identifying the type and the extent of the activity provides us with the evidence needed to support further investigations. The use of UAS has not only improved our efficiency in the logistics of our cleanup efforts, but has also allowed us to safely and efficiently gather evidence when detecting illegal dumping in remote areas.  We are also able to hire UAS pilots through a pay service, send them our flight plans, and receive the data back when they are done flying our route.”\n\n#### Leadership Quote #2\n\n>“The technologies we’ve implemented in GOTCHA will have positive impacts across our other departments” reported Kevin Hernandez, San Bernardino County CEO. “For example, we’ll be able to detect and document illegal cannabis grows, homeless encampments and illegal off highway vehicle use. Initially, we were laser-focused on illegal dumping, but we are finding unanticipated benefits for our early investment in these technologies.”\n\n### FAQ\n\n#### **County Leadership:**\n\n#### Q: How much will the system cost?\n\n>A: At this time, it is unknown what the total cost for the system will be, but it will leverage existing data sources as well as leveraging the creation of new systems to intake and process the data for actionable usage.  It is anticipated that there will be annual ongoing maintenance expenses associated with the GOTCHA platform and its various components.\n\n#### Q: What are the benefits to the county?\n\n>A: Through actionable information the various communities served by Code Enforcement will be able to see a reduction in blight through the additional enforcement efforts of Code Enforcement as there will be a greater ability for illegal dumpers to be identified and potentially held accountable for their actions.  While there is no wholesale approach to eliminating illegal dumping, the leveraging of technology to more efficiently utilize available Code Enforcement resources and increasing awareness of legal dumping options for residents, will help enhance the environment of the county.\n\n#### Q: How does the system work?\n\n>A: The system uses cloud-based computers and existing GIS dashboards to alert staff to dumping incidents.  Machine learning models are used to analyze the various source imaging captured and brought into the system whether it is from satellite imagery, fixed wing aerial imaging, UAS or citizen reported.  When the system detects a new illegal dump site, it records the size and location in the existing tracking dashboard and alerts relevant county personnel to start the verification and abatement process.\n\n#### Q: What SB County departments can use this system?\n\n>A: Any departments that can leverage captured imaging for their purposes, if granted access and given the appropriate security roles.\n\n#### Q: What existing systems does this replace?\n\n>A: GOTCHA augments existing systems in place today, such as GIS tracking dashboards and SB County Code Reporter.  Currently, the county depends on staff and concerned citizens to report illegal dumping. The system is projected to identify and track a much greater percentage of illegal dumping in SB County as it is assumed current systems identifies and tracks just a fraction of illegal dump sites across the county.\n\n#### Q: Will the county be able to prosecute illegal dumping offenders?\n\n>A: Yes, there are county codes in place that allow for the prosecution of illegal dumping offenders.  With additional evidence code enforcement can more easily build a case to penalize those illegally dumping.\n\n#### Q: When can we expect to see results?\n\n>A: As the system is able to collect data, reports can be generated to review historical dumping habits throughout the county.  If Code Enforcement actions are able to be leveraged with the various parts of GOTCHA, areas of concern should show a decrease in dumping, which can be verified upon review of historical images.  Additionally, if sting operations are more effective through leveraging artificial intelligence to determine if any actionable information was obtained, illegal dumping occurrences should decrease in those focused areas as word spreads about enforcement actions and potential fines/penalties. \n\n#### **Code Enforcement:**\n\n#### Q: How much will this system save my Department?\n\n>A: Prior to using UAS and motion-activated cameras, Code Enforcement utilized portable surveillance cameras that operated on batteries. Maintenance of these cameras required an excessive number of staff hours. The installation of the cameras, monitoring cameras for vandalism, frequent battery replacement, and reviewing a high number of images retrieved from the cameras resulted in a high cost. Code Enforcement expenditures for this type of inefficient surveillance cameras averaged $4,450 per week (50 hours X $89 per hour) when deployed.\n>\n>With the use of GOTCHA, our department’s cost for surveillance has decreased. Our weekly average cost is now $1,780 (20 hours X $89 per hour) when deployed. This technology helps Code Enforcement to become proficient in predicting where and when illegal dumping might happen. Accurate data collection and the effective use of it have helped our management team to shift resources where they are most needed. Money that was previously spent on surveillance can now be allocated to the cost of mitigation and enforcement or other illegal dumping needs.  \n\n#### Q: How will the new system help me do my job better?\n\n>A: No longer will county staff and concerned citizens be the only source of new illegal dump sites.  The identification and entry of new sites into the tracking dashboard will be automated by the new system.  It is anticipated that more accurately quantifying the size of the illegal dumping activity will allow Code Enforcement to request additional resources to address the problem.\n\n#### Q: How accurate is the information I am viewing?\n\n>A:  The aerial imaging data is retrieved with a maximum imaging quality of .3 meters of resolution, meaning that the machine learning engine is able to process large illegally dumped items.  We believe that there is a 70% certainty for the model to identify large piles of dumping, tires, mattresses, couches, appliances, etc.\n\n#### Q: Is there such a thing as a “false positive” for identifying illegal dumping?\n\n>A: Yes, while the model has been programmed for optimal accuracy, it can sometimes fail to realize that what it sees is actually not illegal dumping.  This is verified through the imagery provided as part of the alert to staff.\n\n#### Q: How soon after illegal dumping activity will I be notified?\n\n>A: The GOTCHA system will be able to provide staff with updates of the progress of reported illegal dumping activity within hours of the imagery being uploaded into the system.  \n\n#### Q: How do I control who gets the alert of new dumping activity?\n\n>A: Security roles and notification groups in the GOTCHA system will control who gets alerts and what information they can access.  The system can automatically notify staff and any collaborating county agencies (stakeholders) that will work together to tackle the reported illegal dumping activity. \n\n#### Q: Will detected illegal dumping sites be added to our tracking dashboard?\n\n>A: Yes. All detected sites will be added to our tracking dashboard. This will provide us with a snapshot of all collected data and will also create a historical data bank which will help us better visualize and understand trends and patterns of areas where illegal dumping activity is taking place. \n\n#### Q: How will abated sites be removed from our tracking dashboard?\n\n>A: Abated sites will not be removed from our tracking dashboard. These sites will be archived and will be available for future historical data comparison that could help us with prediction of future illegal dumping activities. \n\n#### **Ease of use:**\n\n#### Q: Is the new system easy to use?\n\n>A: Yes, the system has been designed to provide users with an easy tool to review alerts and imagery captured, removing the time spent to manually review footage and images.  By leveraging machine learning and artificial intelligence to do the heavy lifting, ingested information can be reduced to actionable reports within Code Enforcement’s jurisdiction. \n\n#### Q: Is there training to use the new system?\n\n>A: Yes, a training manual has been developed that outlines the various aspects of the system.  Staff will be proficient in operating the system and will use a train the trainer model of learning.\n\n#### Q: How is it decided which areas to monitor?\n\n>:A: The system will output alerts for all areas of the county under Code Enforcement’s jurisdiction.  Easy to identify area names are integrated into the system to allow for focused review of areas, along with the specific latitude/longitude of the location for precision review.\n\n#### Public:\n\n#### Q: Will the new system stop or reduce illegal dumping?\n\n>A: While there is no way to stop illegal dumping, the goal of this system is to reduce illegal dumping. Through documentation of illegal dumping to alert Code Enforcement staff, additional information to aid in prosecution of offenders to help stop repeat offenses, and quick identification of illegal dumping sites either though the automated system or citizen tipping in an effort to stop attractive nuisances.  Additionally, the ease of information access for legal dumping options based on a residential address will help empower citizens to make the right choice to legally dump their waste. \n\n#### Q: Will the new system catch illegal dumpers?\n>A: It is anticipated that the new system will assist Code Enforcement in documenting illegal dumping incidents for review through the utilization of artificial intelligence.  When an enforceable incident is captured and verified, this can lead to additional measures being taken against someone who has illegally dumped and violated the law.\n\n#### Q: Does the new system violate my privacy rights?\n>A: No, the system utilizes aerial or UAS images that are only used for the purposes of analyzing and looking for illegal dumping.  Any video or photos captured are of public streets or on public right of ways or where Code Enforcement has legal jurisdiction to view.  Where proactive monitoring is being performed any captured video is only being analyzed to capture suspected incidents of illegal dumping.  The system and staff abide by all privacy laws of the United States, State of California and any local policies.\n\n#### Q: How can I tell if the illegal dump on my street has been detected?\n>A: You can contact Code Enforcement to inquire if the illegal dumping has been documented and staff can advise if it has already been queued in the system for future abatement.\n\n\n \n### VISUALS\n\n#### Sample Email from GOTCHA:\n\n>From: GOTCHA\n>Mon 9/2/2022 5:50 AM\n>To: Sam Santos\n>\n>Sam,\n>Please find the following summary of detected illegal dump sites from the GOTCHA system:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","format":"Markdown","order":1}],"decisions":[{"title":"Record architecture decisions in ADRs and C4 diagrams","content":"# 1.

Source wide-area aerial imagery from NearMap\n\nDate: 2022-07-28\n\n## Status\n\nAccepted\n\n## Context\n\nAt the onset of the SBC Illegal Dumping Challenge, the solution vision from the workshop gravitated to the use of aerial imagery for identifying illegal dumping activity in San Bernardino County with the assistance of computer vision.\n\n[Planet Labs](https://www.planet.com/) satellite imagery has been used by the county on an ad-hoc basis in an attempt to identify cannabis grows.\n\n-12in/px, fixed-wing surveys are flown over large swaths of SBC county every year to support various departments by [aero-graphics](https://www.aero-graphics.com/). This data is donated to [ESRI Community Maps](https://communitymaps.arcgis.com/home/) and appears in consumer tools  such as [Google Maps](https://maps.google.com) and [AWS Location Service](https://aws.amazon.com/location/).\n\nSBC presently has an emerging, yet fragmented, in-house UAS capability - disbursed throughout various departments (Fire, Public Works, Sheriff, etc.). SBC is in the early stages of ratifying its UAS policy and in-house UAS program + supporting systems for scaled operations. Standardized training is being developed and delivered at the [SBD Airport](https://flysbd.com/) by the [UAS Center](https://uascentersbd.com/), which which SBC has an existing relationship.\n\nEmerging, subscription-based, cloud-enabled, fixed-wing sourced imagery sets @ 3in/px with multiple flyovers per year (primarily focused on densely populated AOIs) are new entrants in the aerial-survey market and rapidly gaining market share with local and city governments. Broad coverage over San Bernardino's population centers is available. Examples: [NearMap](https://www.nearmap.com/) and [EagleView](https://www.eagleview.com/). \n\n## Decision\n\n>NearMap is being selected for wide-area aerial imagery given its adequate resolution (3in/px), multiple revisits in a year of areas of interest to SBC for illegal dumping, low capital expense (data-subscription), and their active research in computer vision aided workflows for identifying waste.\n\n## Consequences\n\nSBC can rapidly tap into NearMap's existing aerial data sets captured over the county - which are substantial. Data service is offered via a subscription model, so no capital expenditure is required. The current revisit time for flights over SBC is approximately quarterly which is adequate for monitoring illegal dumping activity in the county. NearMap is an ArcGIS partner and services easily integrate with SBC's existing illegal dumping dashboard built on ArcGIS.\n\nNearMap coverage limitations exist where Code Enforcement operates in the more remote areas of SBC, such as the high-desert and mountainous regions, but the current coverage offered by NearMap offers significant value in its current state - with many of the dumping hot-spots already being surveyed. Options to extend coverage in the future do exist.\n\nDetermined that the best satellite imagery available on the market and the aero-graphics annual survey (both ~12in/px) are not adequate to support a computer vision workflow for localized dump site identification. \n\nUAS is a compelling alternative with high-resolution and on-demand routine flights, \"Drone as a Service\" subscription models - but absent Beyond Visual Line of Site (BVLOS) waivers from the FAA, remain highly localized. Could be revisited as SBC grows its UAS capabilities and FAA UAS regulations evolve.\n\n","format":"Markdown","id":"2","date":"2022-07-28T00:00:00Z","status":"Accepted"},{"title":"Source high-res, localized-aerial imagery from sUAS","content":"# 3.

While limited in range and restricted by the FAA to visual line of site operations, they can produce very high-resolution imagery for more detailed analysis of dump sites. This detailed imagery can supplement wide-area imagery captured by fixed-wing or satellite-based platforms to analyze dumping hot spots and aid in abatement planning activities (waste classification, volume estimation, progress tracking, community outreach imagery). \n\nAutomated, cloud-based platforms like [DroneDeploy](https://www.dronedeploy.com/) and [ESRI Site Scan](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/site-scan-for-arcgis/overview) make capturing this ground-truth imagery and acting on insights a seamless activity. SBC currently does not have a unified UAS platform, though it should be noted that [Pix4D](https://www.pix4d.com/) is used by Public Works for ad-hoc missions.\n\n## Decision\n\n>sUAS surveys and ground-based image capture to be used on an as-needed basis to capture more detailed imagery of dumping hot spots.\n\n## Consequences\n\nFacilitates planning for abatement activities such as annotations, issue reporting, volume calculations, Flock LPR camera deployment planning, etc. Detailed imagery can also be used for communications and raising general awareness of illegal dumping activities in SBC.\n","format":"Markdown","id":"3","date":"2022-07-28T00:00:00Z","status":"Accepted","links":[{"id":"4","description":"Supported by"},{"id":"2","description":"Related to"}]},{"title":"Develop sUAS capabilities within Code Enforcement Department","content":"# 4. Develop sUAS capabilities within Code Enforcement Department\n\nDate: 2022-07-28\n\n## Status\n\nAccepted\n\n## Context\n\nSBC presently has an emerging, yet fragmented, in-house UAS capability - disbursed throughout various departments (Fire, Public Works, Sheriff, etc.). and is in the early stages of formalizing their UAS program and supporting systems for scaled operations. Standardized training is being developed and delivered at [SBD Airport](https://flysbd.com/) by the [UAS Center](https://uascentersbd.com/).\n\nCloud-based tooling to support scaled, in-house UAS operations, such as [DroneDeploy](https://www.dronedeploy.com/) which was prototyped for this challenge, have made planning, flying, analyzing, and reporting from UAS missions highly automated and simple - allowing field specialists ready access to these imaging capabilities without having to rely on surveying experts.  \n\n## Decision\n\n>Identify candidate sUAS pilots within Code Enforcement to become [FAA Part 107](https://www.faa.gov/uas/commercial_operators) certified via the existing training program available at the UAS Center and equipped with commodity UAS hardware for routine mapping missions.\n\n## Consequences\n\nDirectly training and equipping Code Enforcement personnel to conduct sUAS missions will provide high-quality, low-latency imagery to support abatement planning and execution - as well as address and recurring question heard through this challenge of \"We don't know how large this dumping problem is.\"\n\nLeveraging existing UAS training, pilots, and aircraft in SBC provides a clear path for Code Enforcement to rapidly introduce these emerging surveying capabilities into their workflows as they train up their workforce.\n","format":"Markdown","id":"4","date":"2022-07-28T00:00:00Z","status":"Accepted"},{"title":"Use NearMap's semantic-bands for computer vision aided waste detection","content":"# 5.

NearMap: API](#6)\n\n## Context\n\nSBC and the DxHUB have been working closely with NearMap on a new AI service for waste detection. NearMap operates around the world and has a team of data scientists focused on bringing computer vision to bear on their existing aerial assets to create value for their customers. Tagging and training of existing assets are facilitated by a team of specialists.\n\nSBC does not have an in-house data science capability today and it is not a strategic priority at this time for SBC IT to develop in-house computer vision skills.\n\nThe [California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery](https://calrecycle.ca.gov/Tires/Grants/Cleanup/) manages the [Waste Tire Cleanup Grant](https://www2.calrecycle.ca.gov/Docs/Web/111834) which funds the collection, removal, transportation, recycling, and disposal of California waste tires from tire piles and areas where illegal dumping has occurred (up to $100,000 for a single jurisdiction). Funds are limited to the removal of waste tires along public rights-of-way and on private property.\n\nSan Bernardino County Code Enforcement was awarded a [$100,000 grant for FY 2022/23](https://www2.calrecycle.ca.gov/funding/grants/bycycle/765)\n\n    NOTE: Feature enhancements submitted to NearMap include the ability to leverage their waste detection model on imagery not sourced from NearMap surveys via an API (i.e. UAS imagery captured in-house). There is also an opportunity to improve the feedback mechanism (human-in-the-loop) for SBC Code Enforcement's analysis of model-driven dumping tips to be used to improve future model performance. Additionally, the \"Bring Your Own Model\" (BYOM) capability platform providers are beginning to embrace will allow simplified deployment options should SBC further develop its internal computer vision capabilities.\n\n## Decision\n\n>NearMap waste detection model will be used to generate automated suggestions on potential illegal tire dumping given the consistent aerial image characteristics of tires (round, black, standard size, etc.) for easier detection. Furthermore, the monetary incentives offered by the state of California via the Waste Tire Cleanup Grant will drive further adoption of this solution by other jurisdictions within California.\n\n## Consequences\n\nBy partnering v. building out this novel approach to auto-detection of waste-tires using aerial imagery, SBC/AWS/NearMap will shrink the time-to-value for addressing the challenge of illegal tire dumping in SBC - as well as in jurisdictions across California which have been incentivized by the California Waste Tire Cleanup Grant to identify illegal tire-dumping. SBC will be able to rapidly tap into NearMap's ever-improving computer vision capabilities via a simple API call in the context of a pay-as-you-go model. \n\nThere will be trade-offs in leveraging NearMap's global model performance relative to a localized SBC model for detecting tires from aerial imagery - this performance should continually be assessed and this ADR revisited in the future to consider deploying a custom model for more accurate tagging of waste-tires. \n","format":"Markdown","id":"5","date":"2022-07-28T00:00:00Z","status":"Accepted","links":[{"id":"2","description":"Supported by"},{"id":"6","description":"Supported by"}]},{"title":"Use NearMap's WMS API for optimized imagery retrieval","content":"# 6.

NearMap: Wide-Area-Aerial](#2)\n\n## Context\n\nNearMap content can be consumed in custom applications or enterprise systems like ArcGIS using an Application Programmable Interface (API) or Web Map Service (WMS). Authenticating via [API Key Authentication](https://docs.nearmap.com/display/ND/API+Key+Authentication) is required, and users can choose between either a [Simple WMS URL](https://docs.nearmap.com/display/ND/WMS+2.0+Integration#WMS2.0Integration-ObtainingaSimpleWMSURL) or a [Custom WMS URL](https://docs.nearmap.com/display/ND/WMS+2.0+Integration#WMS2.0Integration-ObtainingaCustomWMSURL) to load in their application.\n\nNearmap provides access to its Vertical and [Panorama Imagery](https://docs.nearmap.com/display/ND/Tile+API#TileAPI-PanoramaImagery) via a [Tile API](https://docs.nearmap.com/display/ND/Tile+API) using [Google Maps Tile Coordinates](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/coordinates), also known as [Slippy Tilenames](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Slippy_map_tilenames). The Tile API is designed to be accessed by an application via URL requests. Mapping frameworks designed to consume tiled maps, such as [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/), [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/), [Google Maps JavaScript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/), etc. are recommended.\n\nThe [Tile API](https://docs.nearmap.com/display/ND/Tile+API) is recommended for bulk downloading of large amounts of imagery and can be consumed directly in ArcGIS Online.\n\nSBC's ArcGIS support team has several dedicated analysts, but only one dedicated developer. The use of WMS in SBC is a well-understood integration pattern while writing custom  code to access APIs requires engaging the sole developer or sourcing external talent.\n\nThe NearMap AI Feature Layer for waste detection is not in production yet and has been delivered to the team as a [GeoPackage](https://www.geopackage.org/) for this prototype. The expected API definition for the waste AI Feature layer would be expected to resemble the documented [AI Feature API](https://docs.nearmap.com/display/ND/AI+Feature+API) on NearMap. \n\n## Decision\n\n>The NearMap Web Map Services (WMS) is the preferred integration method for sourcing NearMap imagery and layering of Waste AI Feature inferences for human validation and prioritization.\n\n## Consequences\n\nWMS is a familiar integration pattern in SBC and plays nicely with ArcGIS. While sourcing imagery from the Tile API by providing a programmatically generated polygon representing areas of interest - the efficiencies gained would be lost to support complexity given the small user base of this proposed system and limited developer resources.\n","format":"Markdown","id":"6","date":"2022-07-28T00:00:00Z","status":"Accepted","links":[{"id":"2","description":"Related to"}]},{"title":"Large, aerial datasets to persist in SaaS cloud provider storage - not replicated within SBC IT environment","content":"# 7.

While service outages do occur in the cloud, the global scale of these managed service platforms provides heightened resilience over local hosting in SBC. Furthermore, the confidentiality, integrity, and availability classifications for this data are relatively low.","format":"Markdown","id":"7","date":"2022-07-28T00:00:00Z","status":"Accepted","links":[{"id":"2","description":"Related to"},{"id":"3","description":"Related t0"}]},{"title":"ArcGIS to be used for the front-end of the GOTCHA system","content":"# 8.

See-Click-Fix will be used as the multi-channel solution for citizens to report illegal dumping \n\nDate: 2022-07-28\n\n## Status\n\nAccepted\n\n## Context\n\nCurrently, SBC citizens are directed to fill out a web form on [SB Access Online](https://lus.sbcounty.gov/code-enforcement-home/) or call 909-884-4056 to report illegal dumping. Other departments, such as Public Works, rely on a popular cloud-based solution called [SeeClickFix by Civic Plus](https://seeclickfix.com/), (an [AWS Partner](https://partners.amazonaws.com/partners/001E000001Li93nIAB/Civic%20Plus)) to interact with citizens in their communities - also known as **Citizen Relationship Management**.\n\nThis illegal dumping tipping user experience could be optimized by providing a more unified, light-touch approach for citizens to communicate with their local government via the media of their choosing: app, SMS, email, phone, chatbot, social media, etc. This multi-channel experience is available from [SeeClickFix Conversations](https://www.civicplus.com/seeclickfix/conversations). \n\n## Decision\n\n>Re-use and expand the SBC SeeClickFix implementation with \"Conversations\" \n\n## Consequences\n\nEncouraging illegal dumping reporting from citizens has to be as frictionless as possible to gain engagement from the community - particularly given current light-touch usability expectations delivered from consumer services today. [SeeClickFix Conversations](https://www.civicplus.com/seeclickfix/conversations) allows citizens to report illegal dumping from the communication channel that individually suits them best to increase illegal dumping tips and citizen engagement in preventing illegal dumping.\n\nSeeClickFix is well established in SBC and should be re-used to the fullest extent - unifying Citizen Relationship Management on a common platform in SBC. SeeClickFix is a fully managed SaaS offering with broad integrations with other digital civic solutions. Cost and time to deploy are expected to be negligible given SBC is an existing Civic Plus customer and SeeClickFix has already been made available to citizens through the SBC Department of Public Works.

Use Flock portable license plate reader (LPR) cameras and associated cloud platform\n\nDate: 2022-07-28\n\n## Status\n\nAccepted\n\nSupported by [3. sUAS: Localized-Aerial](#3)\n\nSupported by [9. Tipping via SeeClickFix](#9)\n\n## Context\n\nSBC Code Enforcement has repurposed [Bushnell trail cameras](https://www.bushnell.com/trail-cameras-2/) for monitoring dumping hot spots with mixed results. The volume of imagery is difficult to parse through manually and the quality is rarely adequate to pursue a citation against the offenders captured in the imagery. Additionally, the required man hours to mount and maintain these cameras with no visibility into image quality or captured events makes the ROI on this type of deployment low.\n\nHigher-end, fixed-camera installations are not common in unincorporated SBC where Code Enforcement has jurisdiction. Traditional installations to support AI-enabled cameras are costly to deploy - requiring power and robust communication infrastructure. Illegal dumping, by its nature, occurs in low-traffic areas - away from established infrastructure and communications (desert, empty lots, remote roads, etc.). Much research was conducted to explore off-grid solutions that could use computer vision, but few exist in the market. Developing custom hardware was considered but deemed an ineffective use of resources.\n\nSBC Sheriff and other law enforcement agencies have been exploring and deploying portable [Flock Safety Cameras](https://www.flocksafety.com/) and associated cloud platform for tracking vehicles in their communities that have been associated with criminal activity. Flock solution uses computer vision running on the camera to register license plates and escalate alerts for flagged vehicles in real-time - the imagery is transmitted wirelessly over cell networks to the AWS cloud for further inference (vehicle make, model, color, stickers, luggage rack, trailer, etc.). Flock cameras can run for a week on a full charge or indefinitely with a small solar panel. Cameras are rapidly deployable by Code Enforcement personnel where cellular connectivity is available (no special technical skills required). Cameras have a wide range of focal lengths for differing environments. \n\n    NOTE: Discussions with Flock to include detection of vehicles carrying mixed loads vs. empty has been highlighted as a desirable feature for this illegal dumping workflow - Speaking with the head of Flock ML, there is an opportunity place request this feature on Flock's product roadmap. Flock has also expressed interest in leveraging Cal Poly's Private 5g Innovation lab for testing enhanced, remote deployment architectures. \n\n## Decision\n\n>Leverage portable, battery/solar powered, cell-enabled Flock cameras and associated cloud platform on AWS to aid in the prosecution of illegal dumping offenders at dumping hotspots. \n\n## Consequences\n\nEnforcement of illegal dumping is particularly challenging - particularly in SBC which is the largest county by landmass in the continental US. Flock cameras will be a useful tool to equip Code Enforcement with rapidly re-deployable cameras and analysis tools to identify and prosecute illegal dumping offenders, deter future offenses, and support other related code enforcement activities.

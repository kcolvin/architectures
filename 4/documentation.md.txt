Snow Plow Route Optimization:
Opportunity: Develop new snow plow routes that optimize the efficiency of snow plowing
operations. Analyze the variables and come up with an optimization tool for Public Works
supervisors (e.g. Spreadsheet or GIS program). This trial study would be focused only on the
Running Spring/Green Valley Lake area routes.
1. Evaluation of current routes and recommend route adjustments for optimization.
2. Automatically highlight when a different piece of heavy equipment should be used as snow
accumulates (equipment speed and performance capabilities to be provided by Public Works)
3. Trigger points when a second piece of equipment or a route modification should be implemented to
maintain the “passable” goal of 8 inches or less in the 10-hour period.
4. Provide estimated time to clear roads after storm has ended based on snowfall depth per storm.
